    "> <img src=\"static_images/icons/noun-info-2558213.png\" alt=\"?\" style=\"width:25px\"/> Note how we are not importing anything from our source code (we do not use any module from the ``src`` directory). This is because the exported model, differently from the model weights, is a standalone serialization of our model and therefore it does not need anything else. You can ship that file to anybody, and as long as they can import ``torch``, they will be able to use your model. This is very important for releasing pytorch models to production.\n",

    "The app will show the top 5 classes that the model think are most relevant for the picture you have uploaded"
