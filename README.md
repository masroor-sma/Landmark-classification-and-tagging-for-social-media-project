## Landmark Classification and Tagging System

### Overview
This project explores building a computer vision pipeline for landmark classification and automated image tagging.
The emphasis is on **data preprocessing and inference pipelines**, not just model training.

### Architecture
- Input: user-uploaded images
- Preprocessing: resizing, normalization
- Inference: CNN-based classification
- Output: landmark labels and metadata

### Tech Stack
- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Image preprocessing pipelines

### Key Design Considerations
- Handling noisy and diverse image inputs
- Separating data preprocessing from inference logic
- Designing the system to support batch or real-time inference

### Notes
This project is an academic/personal implementation intended to demonstrate system design and ML pipeline thinking.
